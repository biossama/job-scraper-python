## Job Scraping with Python

This project is a simple web scraper that extracts job listings from Wuzzuf using Python's `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries. The scraper retrieves information such as job titles, company names, locations, experience requirements, job posting dates, and job links. The extracted data is saved in a CSV file (`jobs_scraping.csv`).
